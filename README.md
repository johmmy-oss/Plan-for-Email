If you’re planning to move from an existing email service to Office 365, it usually takes 2 days to make the switch.
Plan for email downtime
If you’re going to use Office 365 for your email:
To move your business    you need to direct your mail to be delivered to your new Office 365 mailbox. You do this using the Office 365 setup wizard, where we guide you through the updates you need to make at your domain host, step by step.
After you update your domain host, the changes typically take effect in just an hour or two. But be aware that it can sometimes take up to 72 hours for the changes update across the Internet.
Because you might have email downtime, we recommend you plan to switch to Office 365 email during an evening or weekend when you receive fewer emails.office.com/setup
